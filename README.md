# Han Min art

This site is built to show the artwork of Han Min, a Chinese watercolor artist working in the UK.

## Portfolio site - built with Eleventy...

It is a portfolio site powered by [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), a lightweight static site generator. That means you get all the power of a server-side framework but it builds plain HTML files for fast loading by your visitors. This project includes some default posts and layouts you can use as a foundation, and you can customize how your site builds in the JavaScript code. ðŸ“š

## ...and Glitch!

[Glitch](https://glitch.com) is a friendly community where millions of people come together to build web apps and websites.
