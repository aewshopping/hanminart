I paint in traditional Chinese watercolor style, taking inspiration from the flowers, plants and trees around us. My paintings are on silk and on paper.

My home is London UK: I moved here in 2009 to study interior and spatial design in Chelsea College of Art. Before that I lived for a decade in Beijing working as an interior designer.

I was born in Shanxi province and some of my earliest memories are of playing in the rice fields and by the river of my home town. I try to recreate this feel of touching nature in my art.
